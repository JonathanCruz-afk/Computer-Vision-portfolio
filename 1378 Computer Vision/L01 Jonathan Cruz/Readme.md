This was the first lab which explores the real world applications aspect of computer vision especially in facial recognition.

It shows how embeddings and deep learning are is used in order to identify individuals and helped us understand the many parameters/ thresholds in the process.

It also helped us to understand what can lead to a system reading false positives and negatives.

In this project we viewed computer vision applications in surveillance, spoof protection and fraud detection.

This was followed by a reflection to do with the ethical and moral aspects of computer vision.
