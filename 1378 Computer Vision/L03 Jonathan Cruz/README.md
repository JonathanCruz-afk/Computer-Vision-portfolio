This notebook  focuses on techniques such as using traditional machine learning and focusing on practical workflows rather than deep learning. 
It covers how to properly set up our models environment , data preparation, image processing, feature extraction, and applying machine learning models to visual data. 
Main thing is how we can make a limited resource model efficient and operational without too many constraints.
